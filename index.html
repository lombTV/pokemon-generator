    <p>Delibird. The woefully forgotten Ice/Flying type introduced into Pokemon Gold and Silver. There's a lot to love about it: Its beautiful red and white palette, that gentle smile across its beak, its handsome Santa Claus motif, its signature move used to heal other Pokemon, and so much more. While these days, social media tends to allow Delibird the chance to return to the spotlight, at the end of the day, he's always left to be forgotten until December rolls around again. <a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-sm/225.shtml">Learn More about Delibird here!</a></p>
